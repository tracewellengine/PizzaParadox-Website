Pizza Paradox - A Sci-Fi Satirical Web Experience 🌌
Welcome to the Pizza Paradox project! This website brings visitors into the bizarre, satirical universe of Pizza Paradox, where humanity has abandoned Earth, MoonPort66 is the last lookout station, and currency is measured in McMacs. Explore the lore behind Earth’s evacuation, MoonPort66, and other intriguing locations from Pizza Paradox. Built to look like a retro 90s website, this project is hosted on GitHub Pages for maximum nostalgia.
